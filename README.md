![Status: Work in Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-work_in_progress-yellow)


MYEJNYC is a web-based storytelling tool that highlights patterns of environmental injustice across New York City.  
Built as part of my undergraduate honors thesis, it guides users through key findings from the 2024 Environmental Justice NYC (EJNYC) report, combining city data, historical context, and personal narratives.

The project aims to make complex environmental justice data accessible and engaging for residents, researchers, and advocates alike.
